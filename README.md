# My Hyprland Configuration

This is my personal Hyprland configuration. It is based on the `dots-hyprland` repository, but with my own configuration and keybindings.

**Note:** I edit the files in the `hyprland` folder directly, without using the `custom` folder, to avoid conflicting keybinds.

## Installation

Before using this configuration, you must install the `dots-hyprland` repository. You can find it here: [https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland)

Once you have installed the `dots-hyprland` repository, you can clone this repository into your `~/.config/hypr` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbth7777/hyprland-configure ~/.config/hypr
```

## Keybindings

The keybindings are defined in the `hyprland/keybinds.conf` file. You can find a list of all the keybindings in this file.

**Note:** The keybindings are based on my `bspwm` configuration.
